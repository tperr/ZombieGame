# ZombieGame
Final part of high school senior year independent study

This was intended to wrap up and tie together everything that I learned throughout the independent study, which was programming in C++.
It remains somewhat complete, some work needed although I have had some time issues causing me to not be able to complete it.

Followed along the tutorial from the user MakingGamesWithBen, from the playlist in the following link:
